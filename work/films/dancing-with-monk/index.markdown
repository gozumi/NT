The film Dancing with Monk, centres on a performance by the pioneering Jazz musician Thelonius Monk, along with members of his quartet. Blank screens reference the passing of time, and all the moments in which Monk moves to his music are edited together, whilst his fellow performers are edited out of the film. The film is an effort to distill the emotional effect that creativity can have on an artist, highlighting what an artist has to give of themselves in order to create and be creative.
