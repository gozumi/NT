A 'non-performance' can be best described as a performance where it is not obvious to the audience that a performance is occuring.

The aim of the artist is to interact with an unsuspecting or non-expectant audience under conditions where the audience is very sophisticated and aware when it comes to live art. Actions consist of starting conversations with complete strangers on live art.

These performances are responsive to the audience and environment in which they take place, and for that reason have been enacted during performance events.
