An imprumptu guerilla performance takes place in the White Cube Gallery, Bermondsey.

During the exhibition of Anthony Gormley's 'Model' at the White Cube, whilst walking inside the large sculpture NT proceeds to sing lyrics from the song 'The Model', by Kraftwerk.

The lyrics take on a different meaning. The model being referenced appears to be Gormley's physical work of art.</br>
Therefore, as well as appropriating Kraftwerks' song, Anthony Gormley's artwork is also appropriated - as through singing the song his sculpture is both personified and incorporated into the performance.
