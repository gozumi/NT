Mel’s Lament will be showing in Kenya this month as part of the <a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/kenya/43390/european-film-festival-kenya-2018_en" target="_blank">27th European Film Festival in Kenya</a>.

According to the festival curator, Nyambura M. Waruingi, "The European Film Festival brings European cinema to a broad range of audiences in Kenya. This is a great opportunity for Kenyans to experience another Europe that they don’t often get to see." <br>

In addition to NT's Mel’s Lament, the screening programme will include short films by the artists Beverley Bennett, Phoebe Boswell and Jay Bernard.
