NT will be exhibiting new work at ‘This has Nothing to do with Politics’ at the <a href="http://functionroom.co" target="_blank">The Function Room</a>.

The exhibition brings together artists who are alert to and informed by social and political interest, and yet whose works occupy a distance to politics. The show explores this gap and asks if this ambivalence is a politically productive one and whether this dissociation in itself could be a form of resistance to the limitations of how one can be politically engaged today. Taking Berardi's notion of 'withdrawal' or to resist 'with a relaxed soul', the exhibition also draws a connection between artists’ dispassion towards politics and the general disaffection with politics today. It prompts a number of questions around the idea of ‘inactivism’.

artists include: Cordelia Cembrowicz | Chris Paul Daniels | Ana Fernández Aballí-Altamirano | Ella Finer | Rose Gibbs | Marlene Haring | Olivia Hicks | Noga Inbar | Virgile Ittah | Vesta Kroese | Ratna Lachman | Ekua McMorris | Oscar Murillo | PA Skantze | Jack Tan | Nicola Thomas | Geoff Tibbs | Richard Wentworth
