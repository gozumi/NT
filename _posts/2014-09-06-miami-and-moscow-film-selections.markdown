NT’s film work will be featured as part of <a href="http://www.artprojx.com" target="_blank">Artprojx</a>'s presentation of the <a href="http://www.artprojx.com/miami_in_bermondsey.html" target="_blank">Miami and Moscow Film Selections</a> as curated by <a href="http://davidgryn.wordpress.com/2014/07/29/the-miami-and-moscow-film-selections-artist-sound-of-film-12-sept-at-bermondsey-project/" target="_blank">David Gryn</a>.

The works all “engage with music, rhythm and sound and remain resonant from their initial playing. They all have a power that is far beyond just the work, one that creates lingering memory with the viewer long after the work has been seen and finished. The selection of these was driven by their sound, engagement and that the language needed to digest these works is that of audio-visual. These works reflect on the current trends and modes of communication such as YouTube, TV, animation, gaming, social media and used to create new images, sounds and unexpected connections.”

The films featured include  work by artists such as Cory Arcangel, Dara Birnbaum, Martin Creed , William Kentridge, Rashaad Newsome, Theaster Gates, Lina Lapelyte.
