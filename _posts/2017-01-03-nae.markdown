"This is not a show 'about' a coherent movement [but] instead presents works by British African diaspora artists outside of the usual [tired] framing". So say the curators Paul Goodwin and Hansi Momodu-Gordon of their show <a href="http://www.nae.org.uk/exhibition/untitled-art-on-the-conditions-of-our/114" target="_blank">UNTITLED: art on the conditions of our time</a>, a major new touring exhibition produced in conjunction with <a href="http://www.nae.org.uk" target="_blank">New Art Exchange [NAE]</a> which includes works by NT, and aims to show a "progressive stance on exhibition making."

Artists include: Larry Achiampong & David Blandy, Barby Asante, Appau Junior Boakye-Yiadom, Phoebe Boswell, Kimathi Donkor, Evan Ifekoya, Cedar Lewisohn, Harold Offeh, Ima-Abasi Okon, Barbara Walker
