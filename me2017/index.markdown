<b>artist statement</b>

As an artist, <em>NT</em>’s interests include the ‘awareness of the gaze’, and the aspect of looking, whether it is by the artist, the camera lens, or the viewer. As well as the tension that arises from its courtship by the subject, artist, and or lens. The transmission of affect upon an audience, whether through performance, film, sound, and print is also at the core of <em>NT</em>’s work.

<em>NT</em> is also interested in historiography: how history is made, interpreted and re-evaluated, and how these interpretations are continually altered. <em>NT</em>’s use of appropriation is a method of addressing historiography, and is used as a strategy for disruption, redefinition, reinterpretation, and reconsideration of the past.
