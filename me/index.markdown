To relook is to have an additional look.</br>
It is to look again.

Always, at the back of mind is the question, “how can you make people reassess what is already familiar to them?”</br>
“How can I make people revisit the familiar with ‘new’ eyes?”

So my work is consistently about scraping beneath the surface: weaving together and reconstructing different narratives from that which already exists.

A continual attempt to recapture, reinterpret and renew.
