Much of my work is ‘responsive’ where the work has arisen out of a reaction or a response to something which has been observed, heard, or overlooked, in a quest to bring that ‘thing’ to the surface.</br> 
Art, like history, is a process of bringing ‘things’ or ideas to the surface in order for them to be noticed and seen.

To relook is to have an additional look.</br>
It is to look again.</br>

Always, at the back of mind is the question, “how can you make people reassess what is already familiar to them?”</br>
“How can I make people revisit the familiar with ‘new’ eyes?”</br>
So my work is consistently about scraping beneath the surface: weaving together and reconstructing different narratives from that which already exists.</br>
A continual attempt to recapture, reinterpret and renew.
